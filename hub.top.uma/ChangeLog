UMA v.1.3.0
-----------

+ filter branching processes during model simplification
+ additional option to identify implicit places using 'lpsolve'
+ additional option to identify weak implicit places much faster
+ computation of implicit places now deterministic
+ performance improvements

UMA v.1.2.6
-----------

+ model simplification: mapping between event log and transitions now
  a parameter of the simplification procedure
  
UMA v.1.2.5
-----------

* computation of implicit places now in three modes: preserve behavior,
  preserve visible behavior (that is recorded in a log-induced branching
  process), and preserve connectivity of the net wrt. the log 

UMA v.1.2.4
-----------

* refactored code, separating branching process construction from
  folding routine
* fixed small bugs on folding algorithm and net synthesis

UMA v.1.2.3
-----------

* first changes to turn Uma into an extensible unfolding library

UMA v.1.2.2
-----------

+ added methods for simplifying mined process models
* improved view generation
* worked on bug #16257 , now ensuring that events are checked for
  cut-offs in the right order regardless of how the JVM orders them
* moved test cases to the JUnit framework


UMA v.1.2.1
-----------

+ added methods for view generation
* fixed bug #16115: folding routine may result violate 1-safeness of the model
* performance improvements and bug fixes

UMA v.1.2.0
-----------

+ added copy of Petri Net API/Java as standard interface for computing
  finite complete prefixes of Petri nets 
+ extracted unfolder sources from Greta and made a separate project
